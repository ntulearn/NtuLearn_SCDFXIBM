## Short Description
### What's the problem?
Singapore is currently experiencing an aging population and there has been a rise in the trend of elderlies with no next-of-kin. These citizens are highly susceptible to health issues and injuries, and with no next-of-kin, dangerous situations could arise. Hence, there is a need to implement a system to look after this vulnerable demographic.

### How can technology help?
With the use of technology, these elderlies will be taken care of even when living alone. 
Any emergencies experienced by them can be immediately attended to.

### The idea
With the use of tools such as IBM cloud for speech to text recognition and artificial intelligence training, we can create a system which is able to determine the emergency level of the elderly through their speech and automate the appropriate response to that situation such as mobilising CFRS or the SCDF itself for effective early intervention.
