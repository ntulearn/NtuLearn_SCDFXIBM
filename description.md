Singapore has a rapidly growing agin population. Its median age increased from 34 years in 2000 to 40 years in 2015 (United Nations, 2017b). Moreover, the proportion of residents aged at least 65 years grew from 7% in 2000 to 13% in 2017 (Department of Statistics, 2017a). With this demographic shift, there is an increasing importance to look after them especially those who are more vulnerable such as elderlies who have no next-of-kin. As such, our solution hopes to address this problem by having them taken care of by the community through the use of a home system and seeks immediate attention for them when it is needed.

## How it works
This home system is always ready to detect for any distress signals that the elderly would sound off. When the elderly communicate to the home system the issue in whatever language used, the conversation will be recorded as an audio file which would be translated into English using the IBM Language translator service before being converted to text.

The text would then be sent to the Watson Assistant to identify the issues the elderly may be experiencing by referencing with an external data source. Natural Language Processing will be used to process key words from the text in order to determine the level of emergency the elderly is facing and respond with appropriate measures.

According to the different emergency levels, the system would have varied outputs to allocate resources effectively.If the issue is non-threatening, the system may call for a CFR or civilian in the vicinity through the use of the MyResponder app to help. However, if the situation is deemed serious, the system will alert SCDF immediately.

## An example of a situation
An elderly may have happened to fall down in his/her home and calls for help through the system. The elderly describes the accident to the system. With the information obtained, the information is sent to the cloud where it is processed to determine the type of injury and the level of emergency required. If the injury is deemed non-threatening, the system would send a request for a CFR or any civilian via the myResponder app to help the elderly. However if the injury is critical, it would immediately alert the SCDF while also seeking immediate help from any CFR in the vicinity.
